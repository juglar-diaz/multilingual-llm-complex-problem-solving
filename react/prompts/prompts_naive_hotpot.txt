Question: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the "The Simpsons" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?
Thought 1: I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.
Action 1: Search[Milhouse]
Observation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening. Milhouse is Bart Simpson's best friend in Mrs. Krabappel's fourth grade class at Springfield Elementary School. He is an insecure, gullible, and less popular child than Bart who is often led into trouble by Bart, who takes advantage of his friend's naÃ¯vetÃ©. Milhouse is a regular target for school bully Nelson Muntz and his friends Jimbo Jones, Dolph Starbeam and Kearney Zzyzwicz. Milhouse has a crush on Bart's sister, Lisa, a common plot element.
Thought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up "named after".
Action 2: Find[named after]
Observation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was designed by Matt Groening for a planned series on NBC, which was abandoned.[4] The design was then used for a Butterfinger commercial, and it was decided to use the character in the series.[5][6] Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. The name was the most "unfortunate name Matt Groening could think of for a kid".[1] Years earlier, in a 1986 Life in Hell comic entitled "What to Name the Baby", Groening listed Milhouse as a name "no longer recommended".[7] Milhouse is a favorite among the staff as Al Jean noted "most of the writers are more like Milhouse than Bart".[1] His last name was given to him by Howard Gewirtz, a freelance writer who wrote the episode "Homer Defined". Gewirtz got the name from one of his wife's friends.[8] According to Arden Myrin and Dana Gould (former writer and co-executive producer of The Simpsons), Rob Cohen (Simpsons writer) inspired Milhouse's look.[2]
Thought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.
Action 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]

Chris Mullin joined the team in the off-season and immediately became a valuable part of the Pacers lineupâand starting small forward. Assistant coaches Rick Carlisle, in charge of the offense, and Dick Harter, who coached the defense, were key in getting the most out of the Pacers' role players such as Dale Davis, Derrick McKey and a young Antonio Davis. Miller and Rik Smits both made the All-Star team that year, and in the playoffs, the Pacers breezed past the Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks before falling to the Chicago Bulls in a seven-game Eastern Conference Finals.
