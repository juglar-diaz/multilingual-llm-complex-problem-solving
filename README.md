# Multilingual-llm-complex-problem-solving
In this project, I study multilingual capacities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by reasoning, code generation, and tool use.
Most of the research evaluating capacities of LLMs in the literature focuses on English. We evaluate LLMs capacities in four (besides English) of the mostcommonly used languages in the world: Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Italian. This work clarifies multilingual capacities for several popular LLMs: GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, Gemini-1.5, PaLM 2, and Llama-3. Native speakers of these languages can benefit from knowing how these LLMs perform on these tasks for their014
language. To assess the multilingual capacities of LLMs we developed multilingual versions of reasoning. code generation, and tool-using works in the literature. Evaluation datasets and developed models will be made publicly available as a result of this research.
