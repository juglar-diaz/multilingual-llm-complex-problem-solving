Let's think step by step
Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four.
So she has 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs left.
She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg.
So she makes 9 x 2 = $18 every day at the farmers' market.
The answer is 18.
A:
Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.

Q: A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?
A_model:
Let's think step by step
A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
Half that much white fiber is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.
So in total it takes 2 + 1 = 3 bolts.
The answer is 3.
A:
It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric

Q: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
A_model:
Let's think step by step
The house was worth $80,000 and he put in $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost was $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.  The house increased in value by 150%, so the new value is $130,000 * 1.5 = $195,000.  So he made a profit of $195,000 - $130,000
A:
The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000
#### 70000

Q: James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.  He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?
A_model:
Let's think step by step
James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, so he runs 3 * 3 = 9 sprints a week.
Each sprint is 60 meters, so he runs 9 * 60 = 540 meters a week.
The answer is 540.
A:
He sprints 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 times
So he runs 9*60=<<9*60=540>>540 meters
#### 540
